# Red-Wine-Quality

Quality Prediction of Red Wine: I researched the prediction of red wine quality using various attributes from a collected dataset. By applying multiple machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Naïve Bayes, I assessed model performance through accuracy, precision, and recall metrics. This project deepened my understanding of data analysis and machine learning model evaluation.
